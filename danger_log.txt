* If we try to print to std::cout and try to print a char[] or a string, 
the run will fail with "bind error: Bad value for ai_flags" 

* When we passed in the port "12345" from the Proxy constructor, it always errors out
at the part of the first getaddr(), saying "getaddrinfo error: Servname not supported for ai_socktype"
But it works fine if we define the const char * right before calling getaddr()
